## About myPurchases

This project is based on the book "Laravel: Learn By Coding" by Scott Hughes.

## Learning Laravel

If you need to pick up more details of Laravel, then the following is from the standard README.MD that is delivered with the package.

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of any modern web application framework, making it a breeze to get started learning the framework.

If you're not in the mood to read, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) contains over 1100 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, JavaScript, and more. Boost the skill level of yourself and your entire team by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Future Development

The plan is to continue to add further functionality to this skeleton from the book. This project is updated with Bootstrap 4, and coding changes have been applied for the new Bootstrap commands.  For example, the panel class has been changed to the card class.
